### About me
I'm currently a researcher at the Kazan Federal University. I think not everyone can be a scientist, cause you never stop learning new things and answer new questions. That's why I'm always on the way of self-development: this course isn't an exception. In spite of all the advantages, my work cannot provide me all the possibilities I need, like mobility. One of my aims is not to be tied to a certain place, my soul demands freedom and new culture-experience, what I can afford at an online-job. 
I can highlight my qualities like: 
+ on-the-fly self-learning
+ determination 
+ problem solving
+ accountability

     for (let i = 0; i < stringToFilter.length; i++) {
         const currentLetter = stringToFilter[i].toLowerCase();
